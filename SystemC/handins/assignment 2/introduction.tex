\section{Introduction}

This report details the three of the seven exercises completed in assignment 2 for the course "Embedded Real Time Systems". The exercises deffer in what they revolve around, but all have part in creating VHDL code for use on the Zybo board. Each exercise contains a short description of the goal, how it was solved, code snippets for demonstration purposes and the output. \\\\
All code listings are presented in the following manner:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=customc++, caption=Example listing.]
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 10
/* Block
* comment */

int main()
{
	int i;

	// Line comment.
	puts("Hello world!");

	for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
		puts("LaTeX is also great for programmers!");
	}

	return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
