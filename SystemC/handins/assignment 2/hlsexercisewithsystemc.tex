\section{Exercise 7 - HLS exercise with SystemC }
In this lab we use SystemC to write IP cores controlled by software using the AXI4 Lite interface. We make an advanced input/output or also known as a ADVIOS controller. It is able to control the 4 leds on the ZYBO board based on input from the 4 switchs and a memory mapped register.

Our ADVIOS looks like the following
